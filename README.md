Pebble_Rigidity_Check_Contiki
=============================

This repository contains the C source code for Contiki to implement the rigidity check on WSN based on the pebble game.

In order to modify the topology, change the total number of agents in the pebble_globals file and the addresses in the receiver.c. Obviouslym the adjacency matrix in sender.c has to be modified as well.
